							<h1>Kanamo Peak, Himachal Pradesh</h1>	
							<p class="mt-sm" style="color:aliceblue;">If you are looking for a high altitude trek in a short duration and low budget, Kanamo Peak is for you. The name 'Kanamo' is composed of two words, Ka and Namo which means "a white lady". Kanamo peak standing at a height of 19,600 feet in Spiti Valley is no doubt a thrilling adventure but meant for those who consider themselves super fit & have experience of at least one high altitude trek. This is one of the few peaks which do not require any technical skills of mountaineering. However an altitude like should not be taken lightly. You should get proper acclimatization done to avoid chances of AMS which are very high particularly on a trek like this. Kanamo can be considered as a good alternative to Stok Kangri & Friendship Peak which are other trekking peaks in India. From the summit, one gets grand views of Ladakh, Spiti, Pin Parvati Pass, Parang La and peaks of Kinnaur side. The best time to climb Kanamo Peak is May to July. Find all essential information on this page like Kanamo peak detailed itinerary, route map, temperature chart, and photos.</p>

					<h2>Kanamo Peak</h2>
					<h3>Complete Trek Information.</h3>
					<p>We have always wanted trekkers to be well-informed before they go on a Himalayan trek. Knowledge is the difference between a safe trek and a dangerous one. It’s also the difference between a wholesome experience and a superficial experience.

Use this section to learn about the Kanamo trek. It has in-depth information about each day of the trek, what to expect, and how you need to prepare for it. Many years of expertise have gone into this content. Trekkers find that extremely useful.</p>

				<h4 style="margin-top: 2em;">Quick Itinerary</h4>

					<h5>Day 1: Arrive in Manali (6700 ft) and stay there</h5>
					<p>Take an overnight Volvo bus from Delhi and Arrive in Manali on the morning of this day. This day is important from the perspective of acclimatization as we will be going to Kaza the very next day which is at quite a high altitude of 11980 Feet. It is recommended that you pre-book your hotel in Manali online. Explore the town of Manali during the day. There is Hidimba temple which is quite popular. Spending some evening time on the mall road of Manali is also not a bad idea. Keep yourself away from alcohol on this day & for all coming days of the trek.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 ">
					<h5>DAY 2: Drive from Manali to Kaza (12000 Feet) (200 km approx.)</h5>
					<p>Drive to Kaza is grueling already. Not to make it more difficult we should leave quite early to avoid traffic before Rohtang Pass. Road condition after Rohtang Pass is very bad so brace yourself for it. To compensate for the bad roads there will be beautiful vistas of Spiti to accompany you all the way to Kaza. They look straight out of a postcard. After a long drive of approx. 10 hours we arrive in Kaza. Stay will be on twin or triple sharing basis in Hotel/Guesthouse.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 ">
					<h5>DAY 3: Drive from Kaza to Kibber (14050 Feet) – 19 Kms on road</h5>
					<p>Post breakfast, we will take a short road drive to Kibber, which is the last road head for this trek. Kibber is a considerably large village in Spiti Valley. The key monastery is the main attraction of Kibber. We will visit the monastery. You get to interact with the monks who are very welcoming & read the manuscripts if you like as well. Acclimatization walk is very important at this altitude. We will gain some altitude and back to our guest house. In the evening experience the peaceful & harsh surroundings of this wonderful land. Sleep early as from tomorrow the trek begins. The day is earmarked for rest. Remove all the stress accumulated over long road journeys and get refreshed before we start preparing for actual trek.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 ">
					<h5>DAY 4: Rest and acclimatization</h5>
					<p>We have already reached high altitude area and acclimatization process is extremely necessary here. From past experiences, we have realized that the biggest challenge for Kanamo peak trek is its altitude and acclimatization would be critical for your success chances here. We will go for an acclimatization walk today that would be around 2-3 hours long. Acclimatization walk is very important at this altitude. We will gain some altitude and back to our guest house. In the evening experience the peaceful & harsh surroundings of this wonderful land. Sleep early as from tomorrow the trek begins.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 ">
					<h5>DAY 5: Trek from Kibber Village to Kanamo Base Camp (6-7 hours) (15700 Feet) – 7.5 Kms of trekking</h5>
					<p>Post breakfast & briefing the trek begins. We walk through rocky retain, grasslands & dessert valley. The trail is a gradual ascent in the first half of the trek, then it becomes flat with gradual ascent in the last leg again. There are two lakes on the way. One of these supplies water to Kaza village. We are expected to reach the base camp by the afternoon. In the late afternoon. we will go for an acclimatization walk. Do not sleep. Staying awake helps your body to acclimatize but don’t exert either. Rest is important for your body to acclimatize. We will have a very early dinner (around 1900 Hrs) and allow our body to digest the food easily by staying awake and taking small walks for the next 2-3 hours. Post dinner retire to bed in camps.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 ">
					<h5>DAY 6: Kanamo Base Camp to Summit Camp – around 2.5 Kms of trekking</h5>
					<p>As we wake up in the morning, we shall do Pranayams. The day would be critical to assess the readiness of our team for the summit attempt. We will start our trek to the summit camp in late afternoon. The summit camp would basically be the base of second shoulder from base camp towards the summit of Kanamo Peak. We cross the first shoulder in 3-4 hours and walk on flatter terrain for 1-2 hours more before we occupy the summit camp by around 1900 Hrs. Exact location of the summit camp is not pre-determined and would be decided as per the water and other resource availability. However, the idea is to gain around 2300 to 2500 ft. altitude today so that the summit attempt next morning is more feasible. The walk over the scree/snow is very steep. The scree (more visible in the June batches) keep sliding down as you move on them which makes it even more difficult. If you haven’t been to such altitude before you will realize how difficult it is to even take a single step. Do not hesitate in asking for help to avoid chances of slipping down. The dinner tonight would be very light because we have to start the summit climb by around 0400 - 0500 Hrs next morning.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 ">
					<h5>DAY 7: Kanamo Summit Camp to Kanamo Peak (19500 Feet) and back to base camp (6-7 hours) – 4.5 Kms of trekking</h5>
					<p>We wake up at 0300 Hrs and the summit attempt begins at 0400 Hrs. There are two steep inclines that we need to climb today. The first one is extremely steep and should take almost 3 hours to complete. The view opens up immensely after we climb this section. One can see multiple peaks on the eastern side include Shila peak. It should take another 3 hours to climb the last ridge of the Kanamo Peak. All the pain turns worth as you reach the top. The view is rare! Pin Parvati Pass & Parang La can be seen from here. The complete range of Kinnaur region is visible. Also, notice the twin sister of Kanamo Peak; Shila peak which is mostly covered in snow. Absorb the view for a while and start descending back to the base camp.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 ">
					<h5>DAY 8: Trek from Kanamo Base Camp to Kaza (3-4 hours) – 7.5 Kms of trekking & 19 Kms on road</h5>
					<p>We trek back to Kibber by the same route. From Kibber we drive to Kaza on the same road.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 ">
					<h5>DAY 9: Drive from Kaza to Manali (10 Hours)</h5>
					<p>Start early morning drive from Kaza to Manali. Expect to arrive in the Manali by the evening. The trip ends here. *Please note that some changes might be done to the itinerary during the trek depending upon weather or team acclimatization situation. So, either Day 7 & 8 may be merged or Day 4 rest may be cancelled, in order to allow for an extra day before summit attempt that may be used either for load ferry to the Summit camp</p>
